  # Sales Data Analysis Project
## Description:-
This project is designed to analyze sales data stored in a MySQL database. It aims to extract and visualize various insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue distribution across different categories and states. The analysis is performed using SQL queries to retrieve data and Python, specifically the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, for data manipulation and visualization.

## Objectives:-
* ### Data Retrieval:
  Execute SQL queries to extract relevant data from the MySQL database.
* ### Visualization:
  Create visual representations of the data to facilitate better understanding and communication of the insights.
* ### Data Analysis:
  Analyze the extracted data to identify trends, patterns, and other related queries.

## Components:-
1. ### Database Connection
   The **read_query** function establishes a connection to the MySQL database and executes SQL queries to retrieve data.
2. ### Data Queries
   Various SQL queries are used to gather insights:
   * Total sales by customer.
   * Total salary expenditure by department.
   * Total revenue by state.
   * Total revenue by category.
3. ### Data Visualization
   Using Matplotlib, the project creates various plots to visualize the data like:
